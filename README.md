## About the Collective

The Project Leadership Collective (PLC) provides 18F staff an opportunity to share lessons learned, successes, new methods, and know how related to leading 18F project teams.

Project Leadership is the practice of coordinating and representing a project, both to the partner and within 18F. This collective is to help us learn from one each other about the practices and methods that help ensure project success.

## Goals

* Share lessons learned between 18F staff on project leadership
* Identify and share best practices and new methods
* Learn about organizational initiatives and information that a lead is responsible for: Things like: Project Impact, Project Health, and other forthcoming initiatives
* Capture feedback on organizational initiatives, ensuring they improve over time and have the intended impact for 18F and our partners
* Improve your practice as a lead
* Identify and ask about concerns, questions and ideas in a safe space outside of your project team
* Surface patterns across project teams and share bottom-up knowledge necessary during handoffs between teams, term-outs, and other changes
* Support the continuity of institutional knowledge
